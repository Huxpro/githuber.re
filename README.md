# [Githuber.RE](https://huangxuan.me/githuber.re/)

This project demonstrates the tech stack of:

## [üê´ ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/)

Reason is a statically-typed, functional programming language backing by OCaml.

It leverage both the JavaScript & OCaml ecosystems by
providing a familiar syntax geared toward JavaScript programmers and by catering to the existing NPM/Yarn workflow folks already know.

## [‚öõÔ∏è ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/en/)

ReasonReact is Reason's official binding to [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). By leveraging the language power of Reason, it pack React.js' features into an API that is staically-typed, simple, familiar and feels "Just using Reason"

Two of the cool examples are its built-in [ReducerComponent](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/state-actions-reducer.html) and its built-in [Router](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/router.html). Both're used in this project!

## [üï∏ Graph_PPX](https://github.com/mhallin/graphql_ppx)

GraphQL_PPX is a syntax extension for BuckleScript/Reason. It make constructing GraphQL queries in Reason a first-class experience and type-safe with compile time type check.

Check out super cool editor intelliSense support at its [homepage](https://github.com/mhallin/graphql_ppx#examples)

## [üöÄ Reason Scripts](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-scripts)

Reason Scripts is a community effort porting Create-React-App to Reason, which provides a JS-like development environment for developing web apps with the Reason language and React.

It bootstraps an environment to automatically compile all Reason code to JS, provide features like reloading and bundling, and seamlessly use JS code from Reason.

## [üì¶ BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/)

BuckleScript is a optimized compiler and tool chain compiling OCaml/Reason into readable JavaScript code with powerful interop, allowing you accessing the vast ecosystem from both JavaScript and OCaml.

## [üêô Github GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/)

[Github announce its v4 public APIs supporting GraphQL at 2016](https://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api/). Thanks to that, we can play and demenstrates GraphQL power and tools without bothering building our own server first.
